# CI failure triage

| Symptom | First check |
|---|---|
| No checks | Pull request base branch and path filters |
| Validation differs locally | Run `just check` and `pre-commit run --all-files` |
| Workflow did not trigger | Event, branch, and path filters in the YAML |
| Promotion is blocked | Exact digest, required check, and merge-group state |
| Shared action behaves incorrectly | Reusable workflow source and its callers |

Always inspect the failed run logs before changing a workflow.

## Reading a failed `post-testing-e2e` run

`promote-to-testing` in `.github/workflows/post-testing-e2e.yml` needs
`run-e2e.result == 'success'`, so a single failing matrix leg makes the whole
gate `skipped`. Identify the failing leg and its failing scenarios before
concluding anything about the image:

```bash
gh run view RUN_ID --repo projectbluefin/bluefin --json jobs \
  --jq '.jobs[] | [.name, .conclusion] | @tsv'
gh run view RUN_ID --repo projectbluefin/bluefin --log \
  | grep -A20 'Failing scenarios:'
```

The behave summary line (`N scenarios passed, N failed`) and the
`Failing scenarios:` block name the exact feature file and line. That is the
only evidence that identifies the failure; job names do not.

## The `oras` screenshot error is not the failure

In `projectbluefin/testsuite`'s `e2e.yml@v1`, the `Push desktop screenshot to
GHCR` step builds a tag with
`IMAGE_SLUG=$(echo "${IMAGE}" | sed 's|ghcr.io/[^/]*/||' | tr ':' '-')`.
When the caller passes a digest reference — `post-testing-e2e.yml` passes
`ghcr.io/<owner>/bluefin@sha256:…` — the slug keeps the `@sha256-…` suffix and
`oras push` rejects it:

```
invalid reference: invalid digest "sha256-…"
```

That step is `continue-on-error: true`, so it produces a red `##[error]` line in
the log without failing the job. Runs that pass `:testing` by tag (for example
`nightly.yml`) do not show it at all. Do not report it as the cause of a
`post-testing-e2e` failure; find the behave summary instead.
