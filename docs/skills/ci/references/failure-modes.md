# CI failure triage

| Symptom | First check |
|---|---|
| No checks | Pull request base branch and path filters |
| Validation differs locally | Run `just check` and `pre-commit run --all-files` |
| Workflow did not trigger | Event, branch, and path filters in the YAML |
| Promotion is blocked | Exact digest, required check, and merge-group state |
| Shared action behaves incorrectly | Reusable workflow source and its callers |

Always inspect the failed run logs before changing a workflow.
